Description: PERFect is a  novel permutation filtering approach designed to address
    two unsolved problems in microbiome data processing: (i) define and  quantify 
    loss due to filtering by implementing thresholds, and (ii) introduce and evaluate
    a permutation  test for  filtering loss to provide a measure of excessive filtering.
    Methods are assessed on two `mock' experiment data sets, where the true taxa compositions are known,
    and are applied to  a publicly available vaginal microbiome data set.
    The  method correctly removes contaminant  taxa in `mock'  data sets,
    quantifies and visualizes the corresponding filtering loss,
    and provides a uniform data-driven filtering criteria for real microbiome data sets.
